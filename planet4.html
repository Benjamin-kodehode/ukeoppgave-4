      <h1>Kamino</h1>
      <p>
        Kamino is an ocean-covered planet located in the Outer Rim, known for
        its advanced cloning facilities. The planet's ecosystems primarily
        consist of vast oceans and stormy weather, with very little landmass
        available. Its area is estimated to be around 30,000 square kilometers,
        with a circumference of approximately 10,000 kilometers. The population
        of Kamino is small, around 1 million, mainly consisting of Kaminoans who
        are skilled in cloning technology. Kamino is most famous for housing the
        cloning facilities that produced the Grand Army of the Republic during
        the Clone Wars.
