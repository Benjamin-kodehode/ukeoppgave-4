      <h1>Tatooine</h1>
      <p>
        Tatooine is a desert planet located in the Outer Rim Territories,
        recognized for its twin suns and arid climate. The planet's ecosystems
        are characterized by vast desert landscapes with limited vegetation,
        primarily consisting of moisture farming crops and hardy scrub
        vegetation. Wildlife on Tatooine includes unique creatures like Banthas
        and the nomadic Tusken Raiders. Covering approximately 104,000 square
        kilometers, Tatooine has a circumference of about 22,000 kilometers and
        a population of around 2 million, primarily made up of humans, Jawas,
        and various alien species. The planet is famous for its bustling
        spaceports, such as Mos Eisley, and serves as the home world of key
        characters like Anakin and Luke Skywalker.
