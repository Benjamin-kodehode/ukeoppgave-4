      <h1>Mustafar</h1>
      <p>
        Mustafar is a volcanic planet in the Outer Rim, known for its fiery
        landscape and harsh climate. The planet's ecosystems are largely
        dominated by volcanic activity, featuring lava rivers, volcanic vents,
        and rugged terrains that support only the hardiest life forms. Its area
        is estimated to be around 20,000 square kilometers, with a circumference
        of approximately 8,000 kilometers. The population on Mustafar is sparse,
        primarily consisting of miners and individuals who exploit its valuable
        resources. It is infamous for being the location of the duel between
        Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, as well as for its role in the
        creation of the Galactic Empire.
