      <h1>Coruscant</h1>
      <p>
        Coruscant is a vibrant, city-covered planet located in the Core Worlds
        of the Star Wars galaxy. Its entire surface is urbanized, dominated by
        towering skyscrapers and extensive infrastructure, making it one of the
        most densely populated places in the galaxy. Due to its urban
        environment, natural ecosystems are virtually nonexistent; however,
        artificial parks and biodomes are created to mimic natural habitats.
        Coruscant's circumference is estimated to be around 24,000 kilometers,
        and it is home to trillions of inhabitants from various species, serving
        as the political hub of the galaxy where the Galactic Senate and Jedi
        Temple are located.
